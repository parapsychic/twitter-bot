# twitter-bot
A simple twitter bot that retweets

1. Create a file called keys.json with consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_secret and bearer_code
2. Make a Blocked_Users.txt with ids of users to block. IDs are twitter IDs and not usernames. Fetch id using Client.get_user(username='johndoe')
3. All logging will be done into log.txt
